# SEGR 5910 18WQ - DevOps from the Architect's Perspective

## Team project

The three chapters in our text, 11 - 13, cover actual DevOps issues in the wild. You will be studying these case
studies, as teams, and present them to the class. There are twelve of you (give or take) and three case studies,
so please divide into groups of four, let me know your group, and I'll assign one of the chapters.

Each case study presents a different aspect of the DevOps journey for various organizations. I'd like your team
to present the following:

* The overall business model
* Pain points that DevOps was meant to solve
* How DevOps was introduced to the organization
* Interesting organizational or architectural changes made to support the model
* The end-state and any further work

Then, tell us what you learned from the case study. 

I want three artifacts from your work: the presentation (in PPTX or PDF format), a short (no more
than three or four pages) write-up that provides and overview of your presentation (or more detailed
information that you feel is important to the discussion), and a 20 - 25 minute presentation covering
the above. 

Now, my preference is that the presentation is delivered by no more than one person, but, if you
really feel that it makes sense (that is, it adds to the presentation) to have additional presenters,
I will leave that up to each team.

Be prepared for 5 - 10 minutes of questions from the class. Yes, class, you are responsible for listening
to the presentation and asking questions, you might also consider reading the case studies and come to 
class with prepared questions that you want answered.

These presentations are to be delivered on 8 March and I would like the materials sent to me as `git` pull
requests by the end of class.
